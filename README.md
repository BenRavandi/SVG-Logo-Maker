## Description

This application is for making SVG Logo by using Object-oriented Programming. As a freelance web developer, we want to generate a simple logo for our projects without having to pay a graphic designer. In fact, we can use the command line to make SVG logo for our project.

Here is a walkthrough video of this application "https://www.loom.com/share/01c8870ae43f4ef29b3c9ed5dd933050"
